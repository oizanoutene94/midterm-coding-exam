Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
ANSWER.
Data structures are essential in computer science because they provide a way to store, organize and manipulate data
 efficiently.

  Deletion: Removing an element from the data structure.
  Traversal: Visiting all elements in the data structure in a specific order.
  Searching: Finding the location of an element in the data structure.
  Sorting: Arranging the elements of the data structure in a specific order.
  Merging: Combining two or more data structures into a single one.
  Splitting: Dividing a data structure into two or more smaller ones.

what is an Array?
ANSWER.
In Java, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type, arranged in a contiguous memory location.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
ANSWER.
In simple word,arrays are a basic data structure that provides fixed-size and fast access to elements, while ArrayLists
 are a more flexible and dynamic data structure that provides additional methods to manipulate collections of elements.

what is LinkedList?
ANSWER.
a LinkedList is a linear data structure that represents a sequence of elements arranged in a linear order. Unlike arrays
, a LinkedList does not store its elements in a contiguous block of memory, but instead each element is linked to the
 next element through a pointer or reference.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
ANSWER.
An array and a linked list are both data structures used to store a collection of elements. However, there are several
 differences between the two:
Memory Allocation: In an array, memory is allocated in a contiguous block whereas in a linked list, memory is allocated
 dynamically as each node is created and linked.
-Element Access: In an array, elements can be accessed in constant time by their index whereas in a linked list,
elements must be accessed sequentially starting from the head node, making access time linear.
Size: In an array, the size is fixed at the time of creation and cannot be changed. In a linked list, the size can
be changed dynamically by adding or removing nodes.

what is queue?
ANSWER.
A queue is an abstract data type in computer science that represents a collection of elements or items arranged in a
 linear order.

what is stack?
ANSWER.
A stack is an abstract data type in computer science that represents a collection of elements or items arranged in a
 linear order.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
ANSWER.
-FIFO stands for "First-In-First-Out". It means that the element that is first inserted into the collection will also
be the first to be removed. This principle is commonly used in a queue data structure, where elements are added to the
back of the queue and removed from the front of the queue.
--LIFO stands for "Last-In-First-Out". It means that the element that is last inserted into the collection will be
the first to be removed. This principle is commonly used in a stack data structure, where elements are added to the
top of the stack and removed from the top of the stack.

what is the order of complexity?
ANSWER.
The order of complexity is a term used in computer science to describe the amount of time and resources required by an
algorithm to solve a problem as the input size increases

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
ANSWER.
The best case to search an element from an array is when the element being searched for is located at the beginning
 of the array. In this case, the search algorithm will only need to perform a single comparison operation to find the
  element.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
ANSWER.
The worst case to search an element from an array is when the element being searched for is located at the end of the
 array, or is not present in the array at all. In this case, the search algorithm will need to compare the element
 being searched with all the elements in the array until it finds a match or reaches the end of the array.


what is tree in data structure?
ANSWER.
A tree is a hierarchical data structure in computer science that is composed of nodes connected by edges. It is similar
 to a real-life tree, where each node represents a branch, and the edges represent the connection between the branches.

what is graph in data structure?
ANSWER.
A  graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a collection of vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect
 them. Graphs are used to model relationships between objects, where the vertices represent the objects and the edges
 represent the connections or relationships between them.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
answer.
The main differences between Hashtable and HashMap are synchronization, null values, iteration, and performance.
Hashtable is synchronized and does not allow null values, whereas HashMap is not synchronized and allows null values.
Additionally, HashMap's iterator supports the remove operation, while Hashtable's iterator does not. Finally, HashMap
is generally considered faster than Hashtable.


What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
ANSWER.

the major data structures used in RDBMS include tables, indexes, keys, and constraints; the network data model uses
records, sets, pointers, and owner/member relationships; and the hierarchical data model uses nodes, roots, parents,
children, and siblings.


How HashMap works in java?
ANSWER.
HashMap is a popular implementation of the Map interface in Java, used to store key-value pairs. When a key-value pair
 is added to a HashMap, the key is hashed to generate an index that is used to store the corresponding value in an array
 . If the hash code of two keys collides and they map to the same index, then they are stored in a linked list, with
 each element in the linked list representing a key-value pair.


What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ANSWER.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a type of RuntimeException that is thrown when an invalid index is used to access an
 array in Java. This exception occurs when an attempt is made to access an array element at an index that is either
 negative or greater than or equal to the length of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
ANSWER.
In Java, there are several ways to copy the contents of one array to another array:

Using a for loop: We can use a for loop to iterate over each element of the source array and copy it to the
corresponding index of the destination array...THERE ARE MUCH MORE..

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
ANSWER.
arrays are better suited for situations where random access is needed, and the size of the collection is fixed or can be
 determined in advance. Linked lists, on the other hand, are better suited for situations where the size of the
 collection is unknown or can change dynamically, and fast insertion and deletion are important.

What is DFS and BFS?
ANSWER.
DFS stands for Depth First Search. It is a traversal algorithm that starts at a root node and explores as far as
possible along each branch before backtracking. In other words, it visits a node and then explores as deep as possible
before backtracking to the previous node and exploring the next path. DFS can be implemented recursively or using a
stack data structure.
BFS stands for Breadth First Search. It is a traversal algorithm that starts at a root node and visits all the nodes at
 the current level before moving on to the next level. In other words, it visits all the nodes at the current depth
 before moving on to the nodes at the next depth. BFS can be implemented using a queue data structure.


What is Recursion?
ANSWER.
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. In other words, a function is
 defined in terms of itself, with smaller and smaller subproblems being solved each time the function calls itself.
  Recursion is a powerful and elegant technique that can simplify many programming problems.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
ANSWER.
--Linear data structures are data structures where the data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, with each
element having a unique predecessor and successor, except for the first and last elements.
--Non-linear data structures are data structures where the data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly,
but instead they are organized in a hierarchical or a tree-like structure.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
ANSWER.
Big-O notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the time complexity or space complexity
 of an algorithm. It is used to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of its input size.
